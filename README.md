#Touch/Click Paging#

A paging applet for HTML/Javascript using CSS3 attributes for on-screen animations.

This is from a project a wrote that didn't get released but I was happy with how this part turned out.

##How it works##

##Functions###
Note: You don't need to call these functions for Touch/Click Paging to work, they are there should you wish to augment.

###TCPcanScrollRight()###
returns FALSE if there are no more pages that can scroll in from the right.  Else TRUE

###TCPcanScrollleft()###
returns FALSE if there are no more pages that can scroll in from the left.  Else TRUE

###TCPcurrentPage()###
returns current page number.  Note pages start at page 1.  (Just as there is no spoon, there is no page 0)

###TCPnumberOfPages()###
returns total number of pages in the scroll.
