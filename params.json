{"name":"TouchClickPaging","body":"#Touch/Click Paging#\r\n\r\nA paging applet for HTML/Javascript using CSS3 attributes for on-screen animations.\r\n\r\nThis is from a project a wrote that didn't get released but I was happy with how this part turned out.\r\n\r\n\r\n##Configuring###\r\nProbably easiest to view the sample HTML file but\r\n\r\n1. You identify the containing DIV with id=\"TCPpages\"\r\n\r\n2. All pages within the containing DIV that you want TCP to control *must* have an attribute \"data-TCPpageNum=x\" where 'x' is the page number.  I don't currently check for duplicate page numbers.\r\n\r\n3. Within the page div, you can also have an *optional* attribute \"data-TCPtitle=pageTitle\" and that page title will be picked up and used as hover text for the page indicators\r\n\r\n4. Somewhere on your page you *must* have a DIV with ID \"TCPindicators\".  The page indicator 'dots' will be place here.\r\n\r\n5. the TCPindicators DIV can have an *optional* attribute \"data-TCPstart=x\" where 'x' is the first page to display.\r\n\r\n6. you *must* call TCPinitialisation() at some point, eg body onload\r\n\r\n\r\n##Functions###\r\nNote: You don't need to call these functions for Touch/Click Paging to work, they are there should you wish to augment.\r\n\r\n###TCPcanScrollRight()###\r\nreturns FALSE if there are no more pages that can scroll in from the right.  Else TRUE\r\n\r\n###TCPcanScrollleft()###\r\nreturns FALSE if there are no more pages that can scroll in from the left.  Else TRUE\r\n\r\n###TCPcurrentPage()###\r\nreturns current page number.  Note pages start at page 1.  (Just as there is no spoon, there is no page 0)\r\n\r\n###TCPnumberOfPages()###\r\nreturns total number of pages in the scroll.\r\n\r\n##Author##\r\nPeter Galloway, from [Nomadech](http://nomadech.com).
